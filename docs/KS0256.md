# KS0256 keyestudio LCD1602 Expansion Shield

![](media/3.png)

## 1. Introduction

The keyestudio LCD shield integrates 1602 LCD display and six buttons into one piece, which is fully compatible with keyestudio UNO R3 control board. It is very simple and convenient for you to stack it onto UNO board .

There are two communication methods for 1602 LCD display and UNO R3 board, separately the 8-Bit connection and 4-Bit connection.The LCD shield is default the 4-Bit connection.

Under LCD there are 5 control buttons (Select, Up, Down, Left, Right) and a reset button. The 5 buttons are connected with A0 analog input only, so you can monitor button status using just one Arduino input.

Pay attention that the status monitoring is unavailable when several buttons are pressed.The shield also comes with a potentiometer to adjust the LCD backlight.

  Liquid Crystal Library - Hello World

 Demonstrates the use a 16x2 LCD display.  The Liquid Crystal
 library works with all LCD displays that are compatible with the
 Hitachi HD44780 driver. There are many of them out there, and you
 can usually tell them by the 16-pin interface.

 This sketch prints "Hello World!" to the LCD
 and shows the time.

  The circuit:
 * LCD RS pin to digital pin 8
 * LCD Enable pin to digital pin 9
 * LCD D4 pin to digital pin 4
 * LCD D5 pin to digital pin 5
 * LCD D6 pin to digital pin 6
 * LCD D7 pin to digital pin 7
 * Button pin to analog pin A0
 * LCD R/W pin to ground
 * 10K resistor:
 * ends to +5V and ground
 * wiper to LCD VO pin (pin 3)

// include the library code:
#include <LiquidCrystal.h>

// initialize the library with the numbers of the interface pins
LiquidCrystal lcd(8, 9, 4, 5, 6, 7);

void setup() 
{
  // set up the LCD's number of columns and rows:
  lcd.begin(16, 2);
  Serial.begin(9600);
  // Print a message to the LCD.
  lcd.print("Hello,keyestudio");
}

void loop() 
{
  // set the cursor to column 0, line 1
  // (note: line 1 is the second row, since counting begins with 0):
  lcd.setCursor(0, 1);
  // print the number of seconds since reset:
  lcd.print(millis() / 1000);
  int val=analogRead(A0);
  Serial.println(val);
  if(val>=0&&val<=50)
  {
    lcd.setCursor(5,1);
    lcd.print("R");
  }
  else if(val>=50&&val<=150)
  {
    lcd.setCursor(5,1);
    lcd.print("U");
  }
  else if(val>=150&&val<=300)
  {
    lcd.setCursor(5,1);
    lcd.print("D");
  }
  else if(val>=300&&val<=500)
  {
    lcd.setCursor(5,1);
    lcd.print("L");
  }
  else if(val>=500&&val<=750)
  {
    lcd.setCursor(5,1);
    lcd.print("S");
  }
}
```

**What you should see?**

Done uploading the code to the board, you should see the LCD screen show “Hello keyestudio” on the first line, and the second line shows the increasing number.

If cannot see the text clearly, rotate the potentiometer on the shield to adjust the screen backlight.

You could press the five buttons to separately get the letter S U D L R, and press the Reset button to restart it again.
